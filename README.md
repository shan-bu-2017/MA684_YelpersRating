The relationship between Yelpers' rating and restaurant features
Introduction
Background: People argue that “Yelpers” have written over 33 million reviews for local businesses,
with some sporting more than 1,000 reviews each“, and over time, Yelp’s crowd-sourced reader
rating system can make or break a restaurant.”( Forbes, 2013). This altering demand effect has
a far-reaching product promotion power. Thus researchers are inquirying and concerning “How
Yelp Could Create More Accurate Reviews” and “Are Consumer Reviews Good for Business?”
(HBS Working Knowledge). Following up their ideas, my project goal is to determine the key
attributes and features that influnece ratings on Yelp. I use the Yelp online dataset and adopt
data visualizations in conjunction with multi-level regression models to identify attributes and
features correlated with Yelpers’ ratings. I also used natural language processing to extract a
frequency of information from review texts.
